🧠 Stock Market Forecasting

Analyze and forecast stock market trends using advanced time series and machine learning techniques.
This project demonstrates how to process financial data, engineer features, and apply predictive models to make informed investment decisions.

🚀 Features

Data collection from Yahoo Finance & APIs

Data cleaning & preprocessing (handling missing values, stock splits, and dividends)

Feature engineering (returns, rolling statistics, technical indicators)

Forecasting models: ARIMA, SARIMA, Holt-Winters, Facebook Prophet, LSTM

Visualization dashboards for predictions and trend analysis

🧰 Tech Stack

Programming: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels, Facebook Prophet, TensorFlow/Keras

Visualization: Matplotlib, Plotly

Deployment (optional): Streamlit / Flask

⚙️ Installation

Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/khadz53/stock-market-forecasting.git
cd stock-market-forecasting


Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

📈 Usage

Download historical stock data (e.g., NIFTY, RELIANCE)

Run the main notebook or script

python stockprediction.py


or open stockprediction.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.

View predictions and visualizations in the output section or generated CSV files.
