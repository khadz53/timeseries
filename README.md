# Stock Market Forecasting

Analyze and forecast stock market trends using advanced time series and machine learning techniques. This project demonstrates how to process financial data, engineer features, and apply predictive models to make informed decisions.

## Features
- Data collection from Yahoo Finance & APIs
- Data cleaning & preprocessing (missing values, splits, dividends)
- Feature engineering (returns, rolling stats, indicators)
- Forecasting models: ARIMA, SARIMA, Holt-Winters, LSTM
- Visualization dashboards for predictions and trends

## Tech Stack
- **Programming:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Plotly, Dash
